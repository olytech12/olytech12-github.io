<title>FOOD</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant or 
    animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as  <a href="classification.html"> carbohydrates, fats,
 proteins, vitamins, or minerals.</a> The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain 
     life, or stimulate growth.</p>
<p>Historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture, which gave modern 
    humans a mainly omnivorous diet. Worldwide, humanity has created numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including
     a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes.</p>
<p> Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by 
    the food industry. Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association
     for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, 
     and International Food Information Council.  They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, 
     climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.</p>
<p>The right to <a href="sources.html"> food </a>is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
    (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", 
    as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".</p>
    <h2>Food sources</h2>
<p>Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as 
    food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more 
    food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.Corn (maize), wheat, and rice – in all of their
     varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. Most of the grain that is produced worldwide 
     is fed to livestock.</p>
<p>Some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi, especially mushrooms. Fungi and ambient 
    bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic drinks, cheese,
     pickles, kombucha, and yogurt. Another example is blue-green algae such as Spirulina. Inorganic substances
      such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient.</p>
<h3>Plants</h3>
<h4>Foods from plant sources</h4>
<p>Many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are cultivated for food. Many of 
    these plant species have several distinct cultivars.</p>
<p>Seeds of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients 
    necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as omega fats. In fact, 
    the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. Edible seeds include cereals
     (corn, wheat, rice, et cetera), legumes (beans, peas, lentils, et cetera), and nuts. Oilseeds are 
     often pressed to produce rich oils - sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oil), sesame, et cetera.</p>
<p>Seeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and, in moderation, are considered a health food. However, not all seeds 
    are edible. Large seeds, such as those from a lemon, pose a choking hazard, while seeds from cherries and apples 
    contain cyanide which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes.</p>
<p>ruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within. Many plants and animals have coevolved such that
     the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may excrete
      the seeds some distance away. Fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. 
      Some botanical fruits, such as tomatoes, pumpkins, and eggplants, are eaten as vegetables. (For more information,
       see list of fruits.)</p>
<p>Vegetables are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food. These include root vegetables 
    (potatoes and carrots), bulbs (onion family), leaf vegetables (spinach and lettuce), stem vegetables 
    (bamboo shoots and asparagus), and inflorescence vegetables (globe artichokes and broccoli and other 
    vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower).</p>
<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce. Meat is an example of a direct
     product taken from an animal, which comes from muscle systems or from organs (offal).</p>
<p>Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed
     into dairy products (cheese, butter, etc.). In addition, birds and other animals lay eggs, which are often eaten,
      and bees produce honey, a reduced nectar from flowers, which is a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures
       consume blood, sometimes in the form of blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, or in a cured, salted form for 
       times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare.</p>
<p>Some cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or
     ideological reasons. Vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Vegans do not 
     consume any foods that are or contain ingredients from an animal source.</p>
     <h2>Taste perception</h2>
    <i>Animals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: <b>sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami.</i></b>
     As animals have evolved, the tastes that provide the most energy (sugar and fats) are the most pleasant to eat 
     while others, such as bitter, are not enjoyable. Water, while important for survival, has no taste. Fats, 
     on the other hand, especially saturated fats, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.
    
    <h4>Sweet</h4>
    Generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as 
    <b>glucose or fructose, or disaccharides</b> such as <i>sucrose, a molecule combining glucose and fructose.</i> 
    Complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as 
    <i>sucralose</i> are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories.
     Other types of sugar include <i>raw sugar,</i> which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. 
     As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.
    The stevia plant contains a compound known as steviol which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of
     sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar.
    
    <h4>Sour</h4> 
    Sourness is caused by the taste of acids, such as <b>vinegar in alcoholic beverages.</b>
     Sour foods include citrus, specifically <i><b>lemons, limes, and to a lesser degree oranges.</i></b> 
     Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria.
      Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.
    
    <h4>Salty</h4> 
    
    Salt mounds in Bolivia
    Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in 
    low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. 
    <b>There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including </b><i>sea 
        salt, fleur de sel, kosher salt, mined salt, and grey salt.</i> Other than enhancing flavor, its significance 
        is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function. Salt may 
        be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. Some 
        canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food 
        longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. 
        Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.
    
    <h4>Bitter</h4> 
    Bitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste. 
    Unsweetened dark chocolate, caffeine, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.
    
    <h4>Umami</h4> 
    Umami, the Japanese word for delicious, is the least known in Western popular culture but has a long tradition 
    in Asian cuisine. Umami is the taste of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate (MSG). It is characterized 
    as savory, meaty, and rich in flavor.Salmon and mushrooms are foods high in umami.

    <h2>Classifications and types of food</h2>
<h3>Adulterated food</h3>
   <p>Adulteration is a legal term meaning that a food product fails to meet the legal standards. One form of adulteration 
     is an addition of another substance to a food item in order to increase the quantity of the food item in raw form or 
     prepared form, which may result in the loss of actual quality of food item. These substances may be either available 
     food items or non-food items. Among meat and meat products some of the items used to adulterate are water or ice, 
     carcasses, or carcasses of animals other than the animal meant to be consumed.</p>
    <h3>Camping food</h3>
    <p>Camping food includes ingredients used to prepare food suitable for backcountry camping and backpacking. 
        The foods differ substantially from the ingredients found in a typical home kitchen. The primary differences
         relate to campers' and backpackers' special needs for foods that have appropriate cooking time, perishability,
          weight, and nutritional content.</p>
    <p>To address these needs, camping food is often made up of either freeze-dried, precooked or dehydrated ingredients. 
        Many campers use a combination of these foods.</p>
    <p> Freeze-drying requires the use of heavy machinery and is not something that most campers are able to do on their own.
      Freeze-dried ingredients are often considered superior to dehydrated ingredients however because they rehydrate at 
      camp faster and retain more flavor than their dehydrated counterparts. Freeze-dried ingredients take so little time
       to rehydrate that they can often be eaten without cooking them first and have a texture similar to a crunchy chip.</p>
     <p>Dehydration can reduce the weight of the food by sixty to ninety percent by removing water through evaporation. 
         Some foods dehydrate well, such as onions, peppers, and tomatoes.Dehydration often produces a more 
         compact, albeit slightly heavier, end result than freeze-drying.</p>
     <p>Surplus precooked military Meals, Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) are sometimes used by campers. These meals contain 
         pre-cooked foods in retort pouches. A retort pouch is a plastic and metal foil laminate pouch that is used as
          an alternative to traditional industrial canning methods.</p>
     <h3>Diet food</h3>
    <p>Diet food (or "dietetic food") refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat, carbohydrates,
         abhor/adhore sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet. Such foods are usually intended to 
         assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although bodybuilding supplements are designed to aid in gaining
          weight or muscle.</p>
    <p>The process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute 
        for some high-food-energy ingredient.This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's sugar
         with a sugar substitute as is common with diet soft drinks such as Coca-Cola (for example Diet Coke). In some
          snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat 
          ingredients may be used as replacements.</p>
    <p>In whole grain foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch components of the flour. 
        Since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. Another technique relies 
        on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as resistant starch or dietary fiber, 
        to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction.</p>
     <h3>Finger food</h3>
     <p>Finger food is food meant to be eaten directly using the hands, in contrast to food eaten with a knife and fork,
          spoon, chopsticks, or other utensils.In some cultures, food is almost always eaten with the hands; 
          for example, Ethiopian cuisine is eaten by rolling various dishes up in injera bread. Foods considered 
          street foods are frequently, though not exclusively, finger foods.</p>
     <p>In the western world, finger foods are often either appetizers (hors d'œuvres) or entree/main course items. 
         Examples of these are miniature meat pies, sausage rolls, sausages on sticks, cheese and olives on sticks, 
         chicken drumsticks or wings, spring rolls, miniature quiches, samosas, sandwiches, Merenda or other such 
         based foods, such as pitas or items in buns, bhajjis, potato wedges, vol au vents, several other such small
          items and risotto balls (arancini). Other well-known foods that are generally eaten with the hands include
           hamburgers, pizza, Chips, hot dogs, fruit and bread.</p>
     <p>In East Asia, foods like pancakes or flatbreads (bing 饼) and street foods such as chuan 
         (串, also pronounced chuan) are often eaten with the hands.</p>
     <h3>Fresh food</h3>
     <p>Fresh food is food which has not been preserved and has not spoiled yet. For vegetables and fruits, 
         this means that they have been recently harvested and treated properly postharvest; for meat, 
         it has recently been slaughtered and butchered; for fish, it has been recently caught or harvested 
         and kept cold.</p>
    <p>Dairy products are fresh and will spoil quickly. Thus, fresh cheese is cheese which has not been dried or 
        salted for aging. Soured cream may be considered "fresh" (crème fraîche).</p>
     <em>Fresh food has not been dried, smoked, salted, frozen, canned, pickled, or otherwise preserved.</em>
     <h3>Frozen food</h3>
      
    <p>Freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten. Since early times, farmers, 
        fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season.
        Freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most
         bacterial species. In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic
          (or flash freezing). The kinetics of the freezing is important to preserve food quality and texture.
           Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure. Cryogenic freezing 
           is the quickest freezing technology available utilizing the extremely low temperature of liquid 
           nitrogen −196 °C (−320 °F).</p>
     <p>Preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers. 
     Accepted advice to householders was to <i>freeze food on the day of purchase.</i> An initiative by a supermarket 
     group in 2012 (backed by the UK's Waste & Resources Action Programme) promotes the freezing of food
      "as soon as possible up to the product's 'use by' date". The Food Standards Agency was reported as
       supporting the change, providing the food had been stored correctly up to that time.</p>
    <h3> Functional food</h3>
     <p>A functional food is a food given an additional function (often one related to health-promotion or disease prevention)
      by adding new ingredients or more of existing ingredients. The term may also apply to traits purposely bred into 
      existing edible plants, such as purple or gold potatoes having enriched anthocyanin or carotenoid contents, 
      respectively. Functional foods may be "designed to have physiological benefits and/or reduce the risk of 
      chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions, and may be similar in appearance to conventional food and 
      consumed as part of a regular diet".</p>
     <p>The term was first used in <b>Japan in the 1980s </b>where there is a government approval process for functional foods
          called Foods for Specified Health Use (FOSHU).</p>
     <h3>Health food</h3>
     <p>Health food is food marketed to provide human health effects beyond a normal healthy diet required for human 
     nutrition. Foods marketed as health foods may be part of one or more categories, such as natural foods, organic 
     foods, whole foods, vegetarian foods or dietary supplements. These products may be sold in health food stores or
      in the health food or organic sections of grocery stores.</p>
    <h3>Healthy food</h3>
      <p>A healthy diet is a diet that helps to maintain or improve overall health. A healthy diet provides the body with 
          essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate calories.</p>
   <p>For people who are healthy, a healthy diet is not complicated and contains mostly fruits, vegetables, and whole
        grains, and includes little to no processed food and sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet
         can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-animal source of vitamin B12 
         is needed for those following a vegan diet. Various nutrition guides are published by medical and 
         governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition
          facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the
           components relevant to health.</p>
     <p>A healthy lifestyle includes getting exercise every day along with eating a healthy diet.
          A healthy lifestyle may lower disease risks, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes,
           hypertension and cancer.</p>
<p>There are specialized healthy diets, called <b>medical nutrition therapy,</b> for people with various diseases or
      conditions. There are also prescientific ideas about such specialized diets, as in dietary therapy in traditional
       Chinese medicine.  The World Health Organization (WHO) makes the following 5 recommendations with respect to both populations and
      individuals: <br>
 <b> 1.	Maintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using.
     2.	Limit intake of fats. Not more than 30% of the total calories should come from fats. Prefer unsaturated fats to saturated fats. Avoid trans fats.
     3.	Eat at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day (potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots do not count). A healthy diet also contains legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), whole grains and nuts.
     4.	Limit the intake of simple sugars to less than 10% of calorie (below 5% of calories or 25 grams may be even better)[33]
     5.	Limit salt / sodium from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized. Less than 5 grams of salt per day can 
     reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</b></p>
    <h3>Live food</h3>
     <p>Live food is living food for carnivorous or omnivorous animals kept in captivity; in other words, 
         small animals such as insects or mice fed to larger carnivorous or omnivorous species kept either
          in a zoo or as a pet.</p>
    <p>Live food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals, 
     ranging from alligators to various snakes, frogs and lizards, but also including other, non-reptile, 
     non-amphibian carnivores and omnivores (for instance, skunks, which are omnivorous mammals, can technically be
      fed a limited amount of live food, though this is not a common practice). Common live food ranges from crickets
       (used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as bearded dragons and commonly 
       available in pet stores for this reason), waxworms, mealworms and to a lesser extent cockroaches and locusts, 
       to small birds and mammals such as mice or chickens.</p>
    <h3>Medical food</h3>
    <p>Medical foods are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that
         has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. In the United States they were 
         defined in the Food and Drug Administration's 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments and are subject to the 
         general food and safety labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In Europe the 
         European Food Safety Authority established definitions for "foods for special medical purposes" (FSMPs) 
         in 2015.</p>
     Medical foods, called <b><i>"food for special medical purposes"</i></b> in Europe,are distinct from the broader 
     category of foods for special dietary use, from traditional foods that bear a health claim, and from dietary 
     supplements. In order to be considered a medical food the product must, at a minimum:
     •	be a food for oral ingestion or tube feeding (nasogastric tube)
     •	be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements, and
     •	be intended to be used under medical supervision.
     <em>Medical foods can be classified into the following categories:</em>
     •	Nutritionally complete formulas
     •	Nutritionally incomplete formulas
     •	Formulas for metabolic disorders
     •	Oral rehydration products
     <h3>Natural foods</h3>
      
     <p>Natural foods and "all-natural foods" are widely used terms in food labeling and marketing with a variety
          of definitions, most of which are vague. The term is often assumed to imply foods that are not processed
           and whose ingredients are all natural products (in the chemist's sense of that term), thus conveying an 
           appeal to nature. But the lack of standards in most jurisdictions means that the term assures nothing. 
           In some countries, the term "natural" is defined and enforced. In others, such as the United States, 
           it is not enforced.</p>
    <p>“Natural foods” are often assumed to be foods that are not <i>processed, or do not contain any food additives, or 
    do not contain particular additives such as hormones, antibiotics, sweeteners, food colors, or flavorings that 
    were not originally in the food.</i> In fact, many people (63%) when surveyed showed a preference for products 
    labeled "natural" compared to the unmarked counterparts, based on the common belief (86% of polled consumers)
     that the term "natural" indicated that the food does not contain any artificial ingredients. The terms 
     are variously used and misused on labels and in advertisements.</p>
    <p>The international Food and Agriculture Organization’s Codex Alimentarius does not recognize the term
         “natural” but does have a standard for organic foods.</p>
     <h3>Organic food</h3>
      <p>Organic food is food produced by methods that comply with the standards of organic farming. 
          Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming in general features practices that strive to cycle resources, 
          promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict
           the use of certain pesticides and fertilizers in farming. In general, organic foods are also usually not 
           processed using irradiation, industrial solvents or synthetic food additives.</p>
    <p>Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and many other countries require producers
         to obtain special certification in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these
          regulations, organic food is produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by regional organizations,
           national governments, and international organizations. Although the produce of kitchen gardens may be organic, 
           selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the US Department
            of Agriculture (USDA) or European Commission (EC).</p>
     <p>Fertilizing and the use of pesticides in conventional farming has caused, and is causing, enormous damage 
         worldwide to local ecosystems, biodiversity, groundwater and drinking water supplies, and sometimes farmer
          health and fertility. These environmental, economic and health issues are intended to be minimized or 
          avoided in organic farming. From a consumers perspective, there is not sufficient evidence in scientific
           and medical literature to support claims that organic food is safer or healthier to eat than conventionally
            grown food. While there may be some differences in the nutrient and antinutrient contents of organically- 
            and conventionally-produced food, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult 
            to generalize results.Claims that organic food tastes better are generally not 
            supported by tests.</p>
         
     <h3> Whole food</h3>
     <p>Whole foods are plant foods that are unprocessed and unrefined, or processed and refined as little as possible, 
         before being consumed. <b>Examples of whole foods include whole grains, tubers, legumes, fruits, vegetables.</b></p>
     <p>There is some confusion over the usage of the term surrounding the inclusion of certain foods, in particular 
         animal foods. The modern usage of the term whole foods diet is now widely synonymous with 
         "whole foods plant-based diet" with animal products, oil and salt no longer constituting whole foods.</p>
     <p>The earliest use of the term in the post-industrial age appears to be in 1946 in The Farmer, a quarterly 
         magazine published and edited from his farm by F. Newman Turner, a writer and pioneering organic farmer.
          The magazine sponsored the establishment of the Producer-Consumer Whole Food Society Ltd, with Newman
           Turner as president and Derek Randal as vice-president. Whole food was defined as "mature produce of
            field, orchard, or garden without subtraction, addition, or alteration grown from seed without chemical
             dressing, in fertile soil manured solely with animal and vegetable wastes, and composts therefrom, and 
             ground, raw rock and without chemical manures, sprays, or insecticides," having intent to connect
              suppliers and the growing public demand for such food. Such diets are rich in whole and unrefined 
              foods, like whole grains, dark green and yellow/orange-fleshed vegetables and fruits, legumes, nuts and 
              seeds.</p>
